---------------
This is the final sprint of the IT Academy - Front End with Angular course.
My idea was to develop a webpage where users can learn the dance of Tahiti (Ori Tahiti) and Hawai'i (Hula).
The users would have access to various courses for life

It's far from finished and in the future I will be working on the following:

- Implementing an actual shopping process (at the moment the user only unlocks each course);

- Migrating from the localStorage for the auth onto the Firebase Auth service;
- Migrating from the localStorage for the course DataBase onto the Firebase Firestore db service;

- Improving the UI/UX.
- Filling each course with actual images, videos, exercices, descriptions...
- And a long etc.
